            <h1>9 Uncanny Facts About Corvus Corax (crows)</h1>
            <ol>
                <li>Crows Have Shrewd Ways to Get Food</li>
                <p>Crows tend to be opportunistic and creative, commonly exploiting new food sources or adopting new
                    feeding strategies to make their lives easier. The American crow is known to catch its own fish, for
                    example, in some cases even using bread or other food as bait to lure fish closer.</p>

                <li>Crows Don't Just Use Tools; They Also Make Them</li>
                <p>Many corvids use tools, but New Caledonian crows are especially advanced. Like chimps, they use
                    sticks or other plant matter to fish insects out of crevices. That alone is impressive, especially
                    without hands, but it's just one of many tricks up their sleeves. In addition to choosing tools that
                    are naturally well-shaped for a particular task, New Caledonian crows also manufacture tools in the
                    wild, which is much rarer than only using found objects. This ranges from trimming the leaves off a
                    stick to creating their own hook-shaped tools from twigs, leaves, and thorns.</p>

                <li>Crows Can Solve Puzzles on Par with Human Kids</li>
                <p>In Aesop's Fable "The Crow and the Pitcher," a thirsty crow encounters a pitcher with a little water
                    but is initially thwarted by the low water level and the bottle's narrow neck. Then the crow drops
                    pebbles into the pitcher and raises the water level high enough to drink.
                    Not only has research verified that crows can do this, but it shows they can pass the
                    water-displacement test at a level similar to human children between the ages of 5 and 7. Crows have
                    conquered a variety of other convoluted tests, too. The BBC even showed a crow solving an eight-step
                    puzzle in its series Inside the Animal Mind. Crows can also plan their tool use, according to one
                    study in the journal Current Biology, which found crows could solve a metatool problem when each
                    step was out of sight of the others, planning three behaviors into the future. The birds showed an
                    ability to "mentally represent the goals and sub-goals of metatool problems," the researchers wrote,
                    and even successfully ignored an extra tool planted in their path to distract them.</p>

                <li>Crows Hold Funerals for Their Dead</li>
                <p>Crows are famous for holding "funerals" when one of their kind has died. It might be a lone
                    individual or a group of crows—known as a murder, of course—and it may be solemnly quiet or
                    cacophonous. In some cases, the crows may keep a vigil over the fallen bird for days. Could they be
                    mourning?</p>

                <li>Crows Gossip, Hold Grudges, and Know Who You Are</li>
                <p>Several kinds of corvids have demonstrated a knack for recognizing human faces. Magpies and ravens,
                    for example, are known to scold specific researchers who have gotten too close to their nests in the
                    past, regardless of what the researchers wear. Some of the best evidence of this ability comes from
                    crows in Washington state, where Swift and her colleagues have extensively tested the birds'
                    reactions to human faces they've learned to distrust.
                    Led by John Marzluff, a professor of wildlife science at the University of Washington, the testing
                    was born from the realization that crows seem to hold grudges against specific people who'd netted
                    and banded them for research. Researchers began wearing rubber caveman masks when they did this,
                    revealing how the crows were identifying their enemies. Crows scolded and mobbed anyone who wore the
                    caveman mask regardless of who was underneath. In later tests, researchers achieved a similar effect
                    by wearing masks while holding a dead (taxidermied) crow, which resulted in crows pestering future
                    wearers of those same masks. "The interesting part was that not a whole lot mattered except the
                    face," Marzluff told the National Wildlife Federation (NWF).</p>

                <li>Crows Have Dialects</li>
                <p>You're familiar with the crow's "caw caw" sound but did you know their noises have dialects? Similar
                    to humans, whose language can vary from region to region, crows have a deviation in their aviation
                    language between the two populations of crows. According to ornithologist John M. Marzluff and
                    author Tony Angell, who co-wrote the book "In the Company of Crows and Ravens," the sounds "vary
                    regionally, like human dialects that can vary from valley to valley."

                    And should a crow change its crowd, it'll adapt its noises to fit into the new group. "When crows
                    join a new flock," Marzluff and Angell wrote, "they learn the flock's dialect by mimicking the calls
                    of dominant flock members."</p>

                <li>Crows Mate for Life, But They're Also 'Monogamish'</li>
                <p>Crows are social birds and are more family-oriented than many people realize. Crows mate for life,
                    meaning a mated pair will typically stay together for the rest of their lives, but their family
                    lives may also be a little more complicated than that suggests. Crows are "monogamish," Swift
                    writes, adding a more scientific clarification that they're considered "socially monogamous but
                    genetically promiscuous." This means they generally stay with one partner for life, but genetic
                    analyses show that male crows only father about 80% of their family's offspring.

                    Some crows also lead a "double life," according to the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. They can split
                    time between families and big communal roosts. American crows maintain a territory year-round, where
                    their extended family lives and forages together. "But during much of the year, individual crows
                    leave the home territory to join large flocks at dumps and agricultural fields, and to sleep in
                    large roosts in winter. Family members go together to the flocks, but do not stay together in the
                    crowd. A crow may spend part of the day at home with its family in town and the rest with a flock
                    feeding on waste grain out in the country."</p>

                <li>Young Crows May Stay Home for a While to Serve as 'Helpers'</li>
                <p>American crows start to nest in early spring, building their nests from sticks and lining them with
                    soft materials like grass, fur, or feathers. (They may also build decoy nests if they think someone
                    suspicious is watching them.) Young crows will remain dependent on their parents for a couple of
                    months after they fledge, but they also tend to stay near their family for a while longer, even
                    after moving out of the nest. These chicks are still fiercely defended by their parents, Swift
                    writes, creating a sort of extended adolescence that allows them time and energy for play behaviors,
                    which might be important for their development and cultural learning.

                    Young crows will eventually start spending less time with their parents and more time with larger
                    flocks, and face a decision as fall and winter set in. "They can either take off to 'float' before
                    finding a mate and establishing a territory of their own," Swift writes, "or remain on their home
                    turf and act as a 'helper' for next year's brood." The latter is cooperative breeding, in which more
                    than two individuals help care for offspring in a single brood.</p>

                <li>Crows Are Intelligent, But Not Invincible</li>
                <p>It's common for people to vilify crows, often focusing on unwanted behavior but overlooking more
                    relatable or redeeming qualities. The American crow, for one, has been the subject of extermination
                    attempts in the past, including the use of dynamite on large winter roosts. Those efforts ultimately
                    failed, however, and thanks largely to its intelligence and adaptability, the American crow is now
                    more common than ever across a range of habitats, including farms, towns, and big cities.

                    Other corvids have similarly adjusted to or even capitalized on civilization, but being intelligent
                    is no guarantee these birds are safe from us. The Hawaiian crow, for instance, is a smart corvid
                    with a penchant for tool use, yet it was declared extinct in the wild in 2002 after being wiped out
                    by a combo of disease, invasive predators, habitat loss, and human persecution. Fortunately,
                    scientists saved enough birds to start a successful captive-breeding program and reintroduced the
                    species into the wild.

                    Crows sometimes raid farms and gardens, but any damage they cause may be offset by ecological
                    benefits like seed dispersal and eating pest insects. Plus, while any species has an inherent right
                    to exist, we're lucky to have brainiacs like corvids living among us. They help us learn more about
                    our own intelligence and remind us how much we still have in common with wildlife around us.</p>
